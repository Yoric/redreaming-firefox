*A browser for every hat you wear*

140 Chars Pitch
===============

You are many persons, and you do many things. Firefox can adapt to all of them, automatically

Synopsis
========

Today's Firefox can be deeply customized thanks to the use of preferences, lightweight themes and add-ons. However, it has two big limitations:
 * much of this customization is reserved to power users;
 * users can only customize Firefox globally, while much customization is actually specific to what the user is currently doing.

This proposal reverses the flow, as follows:
 * Firefox observes and learns usage patterns (e.g. gaming, banking, social networking, web development, etc.);
 * Firefox spawns usage-specific instances (a.k.a. **Hats** or Personas);
 * Using Suggested Tiles, Firefox offers task-tailored customizations (e.g. elevated privacy settings, activating gaming-specific add-ons or experimental flags, neutralizing all non-essential add-ons for gaming for performance purposes, neutralizing all non-essential add-ons for banking for security purposes, ...)

Power Users can keep the old flow or combine both.

Objectives
==========

 * Tailor Firefox to the needs of users;
 * Improve security;
 * Improve privacy;
 * Improve task-specific user experience;
