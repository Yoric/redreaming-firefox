## Hat Brainstorm

Here you can put ideas for hats and what they might entail.

Some features may appear in several hats.

### Firefox Privacy

We ship all the privacy stuff!

* Tracking protection
* Partner with a VPN provider
* Password-lock Firefox after a period of inactivity
* ???

### Firefox Focus

When you want a focused experience, without distractions.

* The new tab page is relaxing.  [For example](http://www.omgchrome.com/momentum-chrome-new-tab-page-inspirational/)
* Has something like [Leech Block](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/) so you can block yourself from distracting sites.
* Maybe some Reader View boosting, to give you a focused view on content.

### Firefox Shopping

For your shopping.

* Tools to comparison shop.
* Some of the [VRM](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/) ideas turned into browser features?
* Receipt tracking/archiving
* Access to Amazon reviews on matching products (with privacy preserving proxies so only when you opt to see the reviews does Amazon get to see your traffic)
* Re-up reminders
* Shopping lists and wish lists

### Firefox Research

For researchers and students

* Note taking built in, with a note-taking overlay
* Archiving and annotation features; save permanent copies of what you see along with annotations

### Firefox Developer Edition

Oh right, we already do this!

### Firefox Simple

For people who just want to browse.

* No addons
* Bookmark toolbar as primary bookmark interface
* No hamburger menu, no extra tools
* No pinned tabs
* Opening a bookmark that goes to a page that is already open just focuses that tab
* No developer tools.
* Stable UI.

### Firefox for Kids

For your kids to use.

* No addons
* Parental controls
* Time limits on some sites (e.g., Netflix)
* Content partners (we don't have to push one partner â€“ but maybe you could opt in to PBS content, or content from a kids-oriented blog, etc)
* "Reset to factory settings" in case kids muck around unintentionally

### Firefox Secure

For your banking and other things where you are concerned about security

* Picky about HTTPS
* Picky about HTTP
* Entire profile password protected, encrypted
* Archiving tools so you can keep your own records.  E.g., save-to-PDF with categorizing built in.

### Firefox Gaming

Games!  Let's show off ASM.js more.

* We have a game center with aggregated scores, use, etc.  (Maybe partner to make this.)
* Get our partner to support Hello as a social overlay on games?
* Social support from our partner: if you have Firefox Gaming open, you are gaming, it's not like you just left a tab open in the background.  So you are "online" for gaming.
* Easy full-screening, etc.  A little more permissive on these permissions, because we expect you want a captive game experience, not that you are just being phished all the time.
* Save game built into the browser?  Freeze state hard.  Might be good for naive/casual games (e.g., a puzzle game).

### Firefox Social

For all your socializing?  This is like 50% of everything on the web, I don't even...

### Firefox Work

People want to separate work from other activities.

* No distractions?
* ?
